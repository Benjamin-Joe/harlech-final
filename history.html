        <h2>The History Of Harlech Castle</h2>
        <div class="his">
            <p>Harlech Castle is an incredible castle, with its picturesque setting enhanced by being based 
                on a rocky crag overlooking the sea with the Snowdonia Mountains in the background. <br>
                Harlech Castle was one of a series of castles established in north Wales by Edward I after the 
                death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1282. <br> Building work began a year later in May 1283, 
                and was raised in two main building phases. <br> In order to adapt to the restricted space of the rocky outcrop, 
                the building is based on the concentric walls within walls. <br> The castle is designed in symmetrical fashion, 
                with four corner towers and an impressive gatehouse. <br> Originally, its unique position was chosen as it was 
                eminently defensible and was built to take full advantage of its seaside location.<br> By 1289, the castle was largely completed.<br> 
                The castle was strengthened in 1295 and again in 1323 and came to prominence during the Welsh rebellion led 
                by Owain Glyn Dwr,<br> when in 1404 the castle became occupied by Glyn Dwr's court and family until 1409, the 
                year it was retaken by the English.<br> There were to be another two sieges, the first being in the War of the 
                Roses when it was taken by Yorkist forces in 1468.<br> It is argued that the famous song `Men of Harlech?<br> 
                originated during the siege at Harlech during the War of the Roses in 1468.<br>The second during the Civil War 
                when it was surrounded by parliamentarian forces in 1647.<br> Sections of the castle were rendered untenable 
                after these sieges, fortunately however the order to demolish the castle were never carried out.<br>
                Harlech Castle is perched on top of a high cliff, affording one of the<br> 
                best views across the northern half of Cardigan Bay and large sections of Snowdonia on the landward side.<br>
                According to Welsh mythology,<br> the ruins of the present castle were built on top of a fortress that once belonged 
                to the giant Bendigeidfran (the blessed Bran),<br> who lived here with his sister Branwen, after whom one of the towers 
                is named.<br> However, archaeologists have found no evidence for a Welsh fortified structure predating Edward I's castle.<br>
                Edward I commissioned the construction in 1283 as part of his great `Iron Ring?<br> of castles along the Welsh 
                coast to subject the indigenous population to his rule.<br> At that time, it was still possible to supply Harlech 
                by boat as the sea reached all the way up to the cliffs.<br> When Owain Glynd'r laid the castle under siege in 1404, 
                the garrison stationed there was grossly understaffed and surrendered themselves.<br> As a result, Glynd'r 
                established his home seat and military headquarters here for the next four years.<br> The most famous siege, 
                however, occurred during the Wars of the Roses from 1461 to 1468.<br> This siege, the longest in British history, 
                is said to have inspired the song `Men of Harlech?.<br>
                Ever since the Romantic period, many tourists have been drawn to this remote part of Wales thanks to the 
                combination of Harlech Castle's picturesque situation and its exciting history.<br> The German journalist Francis 
                Bromel further delighted in the local tales of ghosts and will-o-the-wisps<br> hovering all over the marshland 
                that had appeared by the natural build-up of silt over the centuries.
