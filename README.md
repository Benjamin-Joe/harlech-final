## My Goal:
My goal from this project is to create a user friendly walkthrough guide to Harlech Castle.
The existing Harlech Castle website leaves much to be desired and I want to create a better user experience, especially for first time users in the hope that in the future this site may be able to bring more tourism into the area.

## Website Layout:
I want me website layout to be easy and self explanatory for new users. By keeping the layout fairly basic I believe I am able to create a good user experience as the flow of the website isn't complicated to follow.

## Color

I went for white for the background, with a splash of orange in some areas. Green for the footer, and a small amount of light gray. Those colors sound a bit of a strange combination, but I think it's quite eye catching.

## Website Pages:
The Website pages are as follows:
Homepage - Containing a hero image, some basic information about Harlech Castle.
History - The history page contains a very interesting documentary as I feel most users would rather watch a video than read large amounts of information.
Gallery - The gallery section is what i'm most proud of, it contains my favorite images of Harlech Castle and a description bellow each image.
Fun Facts - In creating a fun fact page I believe I am able to engage with users by giving them quick and fun little bites of information.

## Problems encountered:
I encountered many problems during the creation of this website. I have had major issues with understanding media queries. I also had an issue with my gitpod dashboard that meant i couldn't access my work for a few hours. Each problem I encountered I took some time to look into the issue myself before reaching out for help to see if I could find a solution alone.

## Help Recieved
I was very lucky to have been given a great and patient mentor who has helped me through any and all issues I encountered. I also had some tutor help on code institute, he was incredibly helpful and put me back on track when things seemed to be falling appart.
