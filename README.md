# Harlech Castle Website

link

My Goal:
My goal from this project is to create a user friendly walkthrough guide to Harlech Castle.
The existing Harlech Castle website leaves much to be desired and I want to create a better user experience, especially for first time users in the hope that in the future this site may be able to bring more tourism into the area.
