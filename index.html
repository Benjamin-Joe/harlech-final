            <h2>Brief Summary</h2>
            <p>Harlech Castle or "Castell Harlech" as it's pronounced in Wales, is situated at the top of a town named
                Harlech.
                Harlech is located in a county named Gwynedd, in north Wales. The castle was built between the years
                1282 and 1289 at the cost of £8,190 at the time.
                When ajusted for inflation that number is roughly £13,109,797.44 in todays money.
                The building has remained standing throughout the centuries despite being involved in several wars.
                Today the building is open to tourists. The money made from tourism helps to keep the castle well
                maintained, and also brings in money for the local community.</p>
